## Rendering with Filament

### Native Linux, macOS and Windows

You must create an `Engine`, a `Renderer` and a `SwapChain`. The `SwapChain` is created from a
native window pointer (an `NSView` on macOS or a `HWND` on Windows for instance):

```c++
Engine* engine = Engine::create();
SwapChain* swapChain = engine->createSwapChain(nativeWindow);
Renderer* renderer = engine->createRenderer();
```

To render a frame you must then create a `View`, a `Scene` and a `Camera`:

```c++
Camera* camera = engine->createCamera(EntityManager::get().create());
View* view = engine->createView();
Scene* scene = engine->createScene();

view->setCamera(camera);
view->setScene(scene);
```

Renderables are added to the scene:

```c++
Entity renderable = EntityManager::get().create();
// build a quad
RenderableManager::Builder(1)
        .boundingBox({{ -1, -1, -1 }, { 1, 1, 1 }})
        .material(0, materialInstance)
        .geometry(0, RenderableManager::PrimitiveType::TRIANGLES, vertexBuffer, indexBuffer, 0, 6)
        .culling(false)
        .build(*engine, renderable);
scene->addEntity(renderable);
```

The material instance is obtained from a material, itself loaded from a binary blob generated
by `matc`:

```c++
Material* material = Material::Builder()
        .package((void*) BAKED_MATERIAL_PACKAGE, sizeof(BAKED_MATERIAL_PACKAGE))
        .build(*engine);
MaterialInstance* materialInstance = material->createInstance();
```

To learn more about materials and `matc`, please refer to the
[materials documentation](./docs/Materials.md.html).

To render, simply pass the `View` to the `Renderer`:

```c++
// beginFrame() returns false if we need to skip a frame
if (renderer->beginFrame(swapChain)) {
    // for each View
    renderer->render(view);
    renderer->endFrame();
}
```

For complete examples of Linux, macOS and Windows Filament applications, look at the source files
in the `samples/` directory. These samples are all based on `libs/filamentapp/` which contains the
code that creates a native window with SDL2 and initializes the Filament engine, renderer and views.
