(this is not a finished or final list)

The necessary libraries should be installed locally as needed to compile and play.
Failing a system-level installation, the `.a` files should be copied or linked to in a folder called `lib`, which should be in the same directory as 'src'.

- GLAD (libglad)
driver level opengl interface

- GLFW (libglfw)
low level management of render state and hardware

* STB Image [included with build]
handle image data of various formats

- GLTF (libgltf)
load models and attached materials and textures

- Enet (libenet)
udp-based networking
