## Compile information

Game resources are compiled to some kind of archive file which is then distributed with the main game executable.

See `LIBS.txt` for  more.

The necessary libraries should be installed locally as needed to compile and play. Failing a system-level installation, the `.a` files should be copied or linked to in a folder called `lib`. This file, `README.MD`, should be at the same level as the `lib` directory.
