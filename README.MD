## Compile information

A modified version of raylib is compiled and linked to the game code.
This can be found in 'compile/raylib'.
For convenience, there is a link 'rlsrc' to the source folder (where the actual build of the library takes place).

# TERRIBLE!!!!!

Yes, I know this is an awful build system. I'll figure it out in some time.
